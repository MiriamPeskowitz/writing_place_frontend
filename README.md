# Writing Place 

## Writing place is an app about writing prompts, but instead of words, there's a place or a space, from history, the natural world, perhaps literature. Each topic holds up to 8 of these sites, and each site has an image and a bit of a description, hopefully enough to spur you on. you can visit IRL, or use the image and description. 


### This MVP is a project for the Flatiron School's 4th project, JS frontend with Rails API. 

The API can be found at https://github.com/MiriamPeskowitz/writing_place_backend
API, deployed at: https://cryptic-garden-28538.herokuapp.com/api/v1/topics

Frontend, deployed at: https://writing-places.netlify.app/ (currently calls non-deployed API)


### Future features: 


	1. Add your own topics and site lists
	2. The ability to see all your writing for each topic together, so you can edit and stitch them together, and see something new grow. 
	3. User signup/login
	4. Refactor using react
